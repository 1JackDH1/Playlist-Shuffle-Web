### An experiment with the Youtube API

It is widely known that the shuffle feature for Youtube playlists is lacking in quality. The main observations are:
- The shuffle feature will switch off and must be reapplied manually
- Extract a subset of videos from the playlist and iterate through them without playing other videos in the same playlist
- Youtube's algorithm uses additional factors to select videos in a shuffled playlist, including viewing history and video popularity

This is a project to play around with the Youtube API and implement a shuffle feature.
